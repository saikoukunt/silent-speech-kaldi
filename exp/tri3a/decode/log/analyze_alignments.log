analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,12.0,12) frames.
At utterance begin, n_B accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,12.0,12) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
At utterance end, t_E accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,10.2,12) frames.
Overall, ay1_I accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.5,11) frames.
Overall, n_B accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,12.0,12) frames.
Overall, n_E accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, r_B accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.0,20) frames.
Overall, t_E accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 0.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 75.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
