At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,10.0,10) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,4.2,4) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,7.5,5) frames.
Overall, ih1_I accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, ow0_E accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, r_I accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, z_B accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,7.0,7) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 46.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 53.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
