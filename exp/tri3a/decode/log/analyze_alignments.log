analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.0,17) frames.
At utterance end, n_E accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.0,17) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 75.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,9.7,7) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, ah1_I accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,7.0,7) frames.
Overall, n_E accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,17.0,17) frames.
Overall, w_B accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,5.0,5) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 17.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 34.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
